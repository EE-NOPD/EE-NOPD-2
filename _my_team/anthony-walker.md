Anthony is a PhD Student in Mechanical Engineering with interests in Thermal-Fluid Sciences and Computer Science. He received his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science from Penn State.

He has worked on improving computational efficiency of HPC simulations by implementation of the heterogeneous [swept rule](https://niemeyer-research-group.github.io/research/swept-time-space) in two spatial dimensions for thermal-fluid science applications. A technique designed to reduce the cost of latency on distributed computing systems.

His current research is focused on extending some the numerical capabilities of [Cantera](https://cantera.org/)&mdash;an open source suite of chemical kinetics and thermodynamics tools. Once finished, his goal is to apply these new tools to resolve atmospheric chemistry with large chemical mechanisms.
