James is a MS Mechanical Engineering student researching Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) modeling of the unique shockwave and light emission conditions that occur after a nuclear detonation.  This project is a collaboration with Sandia National Laboratory's "Laboratory Directed Research & Development (LDRD)" program, as well as Dr. Camille Palmer and Dr. Todd Palmer of Oregon State University's Nuclear Science & Engineering department.

He has previously earned a BS in mechanical engineering and a minor in aerospace engineering from Oregon State University.  During his undergrad he participated in the AIAA High Altitude Liquid Engine (HALE) Capstone project which is developing a 2000 lb thrust liquid bi-propellent rocket engine.  The team hopes to complete a "space shot" launch exceeding 100 km (62.1 mi) by December 2021.
